The web team received the request to build a product/inventory system. The goal is to allow users to create/edit/delete `categories`, and `products`.

A sample of the data was provided and can be found in the `src/data` folder. There you will find the following files:

`categories.json` - contains a list of all the product categories currently available.

}
```
